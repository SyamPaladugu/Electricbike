This is a simple project the turns my normal bike into an bike with electric assist that will aid me while riding, powered by 2 DC motors connect to a speed controller that is controlled by a trottle on my handle.I made this project because  i've always wanted an electric bike, however after look at the price of them I was surpised at how expensive they were. I researched further and found out that all I really needed was an electrical assist not a full not electric bike. This allows me to keep the functionaliy of a normal bike and be able use the motors to power it at any time.
