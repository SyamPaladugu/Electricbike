# Day One(1H)
Worked on CAD models to house the motor controller. I wanted to protect it from the elements and also make it look nice.

# Day Two(30 Minutes)
Worked on Making the Cad model that will turn the wheel of the bicycle. Basiclly is a long tube that will rest above the wheels. The motors spin the tube, the tube spins the wheel :)
